# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Analysis Overview

The goal of this study is to utilize machine learning to forecast the creditworthiness of a prospective borrower by predicting whether they are healthy (low-risk) or unhealthy (high-risk) when granted a loan. The analysis employs a dataset of past lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The researcher's objective was to estimate the number of low-risk and high-risk loans anticipated and actualized by creating a confusion matrix based on various variables. Additionally, the accuracy scores and recall were used to assess the ability of the models to differentiate between low-risk and high-risk borrowers.
